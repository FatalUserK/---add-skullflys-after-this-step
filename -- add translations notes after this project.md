i dont think anyone is ever going to want to translate this modd, but in case they do...
# THIS IS A VERY SILLY MOD
if you are unaware of what this mod is based on, then looking at the code and seeing the in-game texts must be very very confusing :P


The entire mod is based off of a comment that can be found throughout the game's code- specifically the biome scripts which handle biomes and what spawns in them, the comment in question is the following:
`-- add skullflys after this step`

this entire mod is themed after this comment, and thus much of the text is very similar to it, please translate however you feel is best

## SOMETHING TO NOTE!!!!
"skullflys" is grammatically incorrect. the plural of "skullfly" is "skullflies".
this is a sort of weird singular-plural, feel free to use this in your translation if this is something that is possible


## LAST THING!!!!!
This is a very silly mod. Ff there is anyone for some reason committing the time to translate this, go with whatever you feel is right, this file is just here to provide some backstory and context if you so desire.
You know your language better than I do after all o/
